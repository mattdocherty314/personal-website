            <p>
                <strong> School IT Technician </strong> <br/>
                <em> Mansfield State High School </em> <br/>
                Feb 2018 - Apr 2018, Dec 2018 - Oct 2019 <br/>
                As a school IT technician, I and other senior technicians were
                responsible for resolving issues relating to the school computers,
                laptops and related techologies. For example, if a projector wasn't
                connecting to a teacher computer, I had to diagnose whether it
                was the cable or if the computer wasn't configured for the
                projector. <br/>
                The primary thing that I learnt from the job was that I don't
                have to always know the answer to problems. I also learn't how
                to effectively communicate the problem to co-workers so that they
                can suggest solutions that weren't attempted. <br/>
